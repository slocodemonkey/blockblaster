BLOCKBLASTER

Blockblaster was originally an early project I did to develop my skill set in JavaScript and jQuery.  It was functional, but had a couple of bugs and the code was just a bit ugly.

I recently rewrote the game using more object oriented techniques.  This helped eliminate many of the bugs in the early version, and made the program itself simpler.
