BLOCKBLASTER

Blockblaster is a really simple web based video game using JavaScript and jQuery.  I wrote it as a first project.

The game loop adds a DIV to the HTML page, which is formatted using CSS.  That div is then animated using the dropIt function, and if the user clicks on it, it explodes.  The game is over if the block reaches the bottom of the game area.
